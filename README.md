# phases_IUV_n_video
Mass-weighted PDF in (IUV, n) plane vs height z above the Galactic midplane. Contours show where neutral gas resides relative to thermal phases (CNM/UNM/WNM), shifting to lower densities with increasing z. The distribution transitions from CNM-dominated near the midplane to WNM-dominated at higher altitudes, reflecting the ISM's vertical structure
